        <h2>Allama Iqbal is the National Poet of Pakistan</h2>
        <p> <b>Sir Muhammad Iqbal (Urdu: محمد اقبال; 9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938),</b> was a South Asian Muslim writer,[1][2] philosopher,[3] and politician,[4] whose poetry in the Urdu language is considered among the greatest of the twentieth century,[5][6][7][8] and whose vision of a cultural and political ideal for the Muslims of British-ruled India[9] was to animate the impulse for Pakistan.[1][10] He is commonly referred to by the honorific Allama[11] (from Persian: علامہ, romanized: ʿallāma, lit. 'very knowing, most learned').[12]
        Born and raised in Sialkot, Punjab in an ethnic Kashmiri Muslim family, Iqbal completed his B.A. and M.A. at the Government College Lahore. He taught Arabic at the Oriental College, Lahore from 1899 until 1903. During this time, he wrote prolifically. Among the Urdu poems from this time that remain popular are Parinde ki faryad (A bird's prayer), an early meditation on animal rights, and Tarana-e-Hindi (The Song of India) a patriotic poem—both poems composed for children. In 1905, he left for further studies in Europe, first to England, where he completed a second B.A. at Trinity College, Cambridge and was subsequently called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and then to Germany, where he received a Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Munich. After returning to Lahore in 1908, he established a law practice but concentrated on writing scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy, and religion. He is best known for his poetic works,</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in a Punjabi-speaking Kashmiri[15] family from Sialkot in the Punjab Province of British India (now in Pakistan).[16] His family traced their ancestry to Kashmiri Pandits (of the Sapru clan) who converted to Islam in the 15th century[17] and were from a south Kashmiri village in Kulgam.[18] Iqbal conversed only in Punjabi and Urdu in his daily life.[19] In the 19th century, when the Sikh Empire was conquering Kashmir, his grandfather's family migrated to Punjab. Iqbal's grandfather was an eighth cousin of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, an important lawyer and freedom fighter who would eventually become an admirer of Iqbal.[20] Iqbal often mentioned and commemorated his Kashmiri lineage in his writings.[21][22] According to scholar Annemarie Schimmel, Iqbal often wrote about his being "a son of Kashmiri-Brahmans but (being) acquainted with the wisdom of Rumi and Tabrizi."[23]

        Iqbal's father, Sheikh Noor Muhammad (died 1930), was a tailor, not formally educated, but a religious man.[24][25] Iqbal's mother Imam Bibi, a Kashmiri from Sambrial,[26] was described as a polite and humble woman who helped the poor and her neighbours with their problems. She died on 9 November 1914 in Sialkot.[27][28] Iqbal loved his mother, and on her death he expressed his feelings of pathos in an elegy:[24]</p>
